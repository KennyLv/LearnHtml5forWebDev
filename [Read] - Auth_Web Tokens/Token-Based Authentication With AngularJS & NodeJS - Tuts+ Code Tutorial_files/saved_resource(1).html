<p>The point is to have the signature part match your backend authentication... if your token includes the user-id and some dates to expire said token, you can actually check if the token is expired before doing a hash check... you can also cache the authorized tokens on your backend to take that part out...</p><p>JWT does allow for encrypted tokens though... this creates more overhead on the servers though.</p>

<p>Nice writeup. There's actually two things I'd like to add:</p><p>1. Your `ensureAuthorized` is doing nothing, basically. You should make sure that it is a valid token (including expire date) and hasn't been tampered with by decoding it with the same key you used to encode it.</p><p>2. You don't need to persist the token with the user model. Besides mixing user data with authentication data, it is unnecessary. If you enforce the uniqueness of the email (`email: { type: 'String', unique: true }`), after making sure you have a valid token, you'll be able to fetch the user by email address.</p><p>Cheers!</p>

<p>Hi <a data-dsq-mention="guilhermetramontina:disqus" href="https://disqus.com/by/guilhermetramontina/" rel="nofollow" class="mention">Guilherme Tramontina</a>,<br>Thanks for your opinions. And Here is my answers;</p><p>1) Yes, you are right . Actually, There would be a db check to check token from database on every request. Actually, there was a comment line there for describing db operations. Sorry, to forget to put there. I will change it in codebase in github project.</p><p>2) Yes, also you can use only email, because that is unique. In bearer tokens, you are providing a payload, and I preferred to provide user basic information. I provide user name, surname for using that information on frontend to display username on logged in pages, like "Welcome, John Doe".</p><p>You are right on both topics, thanks for your opinions</p>

<p>Sorry if this is a silly question, maybe I'm missing something, but in the POST /authenticate code, the line that finds the user:<br>User.findOne({email: <a href="http://req.body.email/" rel="nofollow">req.body.email</a>, password: req.body.password}</p><p>It looks like it's just taking the plain text password from request and passing that as-is to database for lookup. Does this mean the password is stored as plain text in the database? Or is it hashed somewhere and I just missed that part of the code?</p>

<p>Thanks for writing this up, I've some comments on this:</p><p>1 - Those tokens you generate never expires, I didn't see expiry claims in the JWT response, OAuth 2.0 bearer tokens are like cash if anyone have them, then they can access your protected resources, those tokens should have expiry time.</p><p>2 - You are currently implementing OAuth 2.0 resource owner credential flow, it will be great if you configured your end point "authenticate" to accept parameter of grant_type: "password" and send the request payload using content-type "x-www-form-urlencoded" so it adhere to OAuth 2.0 specifications.</p><p>3 - Usually non-confidential clients (JS applications running in browser) are not allowed to use grant type: "refresh_token". This grant enables resource owners to obtain new access tokens silently without providing username/password, but you can work around this by configuring CORS correctly on the server and allowing origin for your front end only. You can check my implementation on how to enable Oauth 2.0 refresh tokens here:</p>

<p>for making the app full secure we should send all the html and js files over HTTPS and the part of our api that get the token from server should be over HTTPS too , with this we can send other api requests with HTTP and be sure of security with JWT (it just has performance overcome over HTTPS) , an attacker can read the payload but cannot changing it.</p><p>but if we send all our requests through HTTPS , we even do not need JWT , that make a extra hmac hashing step that is not usable , HTTPS is enough. I prefer to use HTTPS and not usnig JWT at all.</p>

<p>Well, then you would need to write code that does that, or pops open a login modal for the user.  This token method won't write you app for you, of course.</p><p>I don't use Angular (I use Backbone instead), and with Backbone you could extend the models from a base model.  In that base model there could be a parse method which would look for particular response codes that indicate the user's session has expired, or token needs to be replaced with a new one, that sort of thing.  I'm guessing Angular may have a similar mechanism.  Perhaps that could be used to determine if/when the token needs to be replaced.</p><p>Hope that helps.</p>
