Jumperbot
=========
A game, developed using HTML-5 canvas and Javascript, in which you (the bot) have to jump i.e. by throwing ropes at the bars by shooting at them. Every time you will go higher i.e. the bars will move down, you will earn score.

Feel free to improve or add any functionality.

Thanks to [Guillaume Juvenet](http://www.guillaumejuvenet.com/) for letting me use his bot in the game.

Happy Jumping!
